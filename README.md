# Unix Config and Dotfiles

This repository contains my portable Unix home directory configuration
dotfiles.  It should be cloned as a bare git repository into $HOME/.cfg,
then checked out with a working directory of $HOME.

This is based on the approach described in [this blog
post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/),
based on a [Hacker News comment by
StreakyCobra](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754).
